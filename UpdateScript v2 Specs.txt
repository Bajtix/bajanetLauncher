=== UpdateScript v2 Standard ===

Header: updatescript v2.0
Content:
The script consists of blocks - each one can correlate to one or many versions. Internally, versions are integers, but can be written as floats in the script. This is an example of a block definition;

@0.1.0; 0.2.0; 0.2.1

They mustn't contain any letters, but can contain spaces for clarity - they are skipped in the parsing.
Reset versions are marked as follows;

! ( version comment / any text)

The normal way of installing a version is to install everything from the last reset up to the selected one.
Resets are there so we dont have to install everything - you can just install from the latest reset. The code between a reset and another version block is the cleanup code - it will run if you are upgrading from the previous version.
